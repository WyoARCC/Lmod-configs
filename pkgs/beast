BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences
using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured 
phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be 
used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for 
testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology.
BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted 
proportional to its posterior probability. We include a simple to 
use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a suit of 
programs for analysing the results.
